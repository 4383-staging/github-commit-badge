- Have one badge as template in html
 - Clone template for each repo, with id of repo
 - Two calls to github per repo, issue at the same time!
  - Callback for each call is SEPARATE function which updates the corresponding div#repo

- Get rid of stupid <script> stuff
- Get rid of humane

- Make things configurable (in github-commit-badge.js), like: dateformat, commit-message-length, gravatar size
- Rewrite the whole thing in jQuery to make it prettier and more portable

- Request repo-info first and then use master_branch (http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/) if no branch configured

Much later
----------
- CoffeeScript instead of JavaScript
